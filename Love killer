I gave me the warning sigh of the storm of the heartbreak 
when you clearly did not love me enough your a love killer 
the flood of you came and drown me underneath the oceans
I realize when I came up for air the fight of that light 
might burn bright turn to be right when the stars in the sky shine 
that's my guide to lead me to you
